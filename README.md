# LIRI Bot  

## Live Link
Since this is mainly done through the terminal/command line, the files need to be downloaded locally.

## Description on how to use the app
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. Commands are as follows: node .. spotify-this-song; node .. movie-this; node .. my-tweets; node .. do-what-it-says; node .. help.

## Requirements
- Have functoinality for the following:
1. spotify-this-song (Spotify npm package functionality)
2. movie-this (OMDB npm package functionality)
3. my-tweets (Twitter npm package functionality)
4. do-what-it-says (fs npm package functionality)

## Technologies Used
#### Use bullets to list out the technologies used. For example,
- Node.js for the entirety of this project. NPM packages,
- git Bash/Mac Terminal for interaction with LIRI.
- JavaScript for all the functionality.
- Twitter NPM, Spotify NPM, Request NPM, and FS NPM

## Code Explaination
- Had to refactor the majority of my code when I got to the 'do-what-it-says' portion of LIRI, as I didn't thoroughly pseudo-code this time around. Have looked into practicing more 'best practices' for writing my code, and will be focusing my studies on that portion as I feel that I should group my code into a function more often so it's easier to call upon it, and also apply recursion if necessary.
